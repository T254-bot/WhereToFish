# Site Overview 


# Planning 

## Target Audiences:


### User Stories:

* As a user I want to understand the sites purpose.

* As a user I want to find fishing lakes around my area.

* As a user I want to be able to save my favorite fishing lakes and view them all in one place .

* As a user I want to be able to use a saved location for my searches.

* As a user I want to be able to update my saved details easily.

## Color Scheme:

When choosing the colors, I wanted the design of my site to mimic the visual experience of going fishing. So I chose a light green and a dark brown color to use as the footer and navbar background, to imitate the brown of dirt and bark, along with the lightgreen of the leaves of a tree or grass in the sunlight. Then I decided on a light blue background for the main body of the page to represent the water of the lake. The only place this styling differs is on the account page. There I chose a dark green color for the main body, to represent the color a bivvy or grass, so the account page gives the user the feeling that this is their hub so to speak, away from the activity.

Below is a grid that I have used to check the contrast scores so as to be sure all text remains readable throughout the site, created on https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/ .

* The only color combinations used are those that pass.

## Wireframes:

Here are my wireframes that I created at the start of my project and used as the rough template for my site, for mobile, tablet and desktop viewing. Below them you will find a list detailing how the design has changed as the development process was going on. More information on why these changes where made will be found below.

## Responsiveness Testing:

I began testing the responsiveness of the site firstly by switching through different device screen sizes using developer tools on google chrome on each page and using every feature at each main breakpoint. Below you will find a screenshot of the full list of the device screen sizes used.
